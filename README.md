# Sinhala OCR Engine

> **⚠️ Development Phase**: This project is currently under active development. Features, APIs, and documentation are subject to change.

## Overview

**Sinhala OCR** is a production-grade Optical Character Recognition system specifically designed for the Sinhala script. Built on top of [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR), this project aims to deliver state-of-the-art text recognition capabilities for Sinhala language documents, including printed text, digital documents, and real-world scene images.

## Motivation

While general-purpose OCR systems exist, Sinhala script presents unique challenges due to its complex character set, extensive use of diacritical marks, and intricate grapheme clusters. This project addresses these challenges by building a specialized OCR engine that understands the linguistic and typographic nuances of Sinhala.

## Key Features

- **Sinhala-Native Recognition**: Comprehensive support for the full Sinhala Unicode character set (200+ characters)
- **Diacritic Handling**: Accurate recognition of vowel signs, consonant modifiers, and zero-width joiners
- **Real-World Robustness**: Optimized for various image conditions including scans, photos, and low-quality inputs
- **Production-Ready**: Designed for deployment in real-world applications with performance and reliability in mind

## Technology Stack

This project is built upon:
- **[PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)** - Industry-leading OCR framework
- **[PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle)** - Deep learning platform
- Custom modifications and enhancements specifically for Sinhala script

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives are:

1. **Accuracy**: Achieve industry-leading recognition accuracy for Sinhala text across various document types
2. **Performance**: Deliver fast inference suitable for real-time applications
3. **Accessibility**: Make Sinhala OCR technology freely available to researchers, developers, and businesses
4. **Scalability**: Build a system that can be deployed from edge devices to cloud infrastructure

## Current Status

🚧 **Under Development**

We are actively working on:
- Training and optimizing recognition models
- Building comprehensive Sinhala datasets
- Implementing production deployment pipelines
- Developing evaluation benchmarks

## Use Cases

This OCR engine can be applied to:

- **Document Digitization**: Converting historical Sinhala documents and books into digital text
- **Archive Preservation**: Digitizing government records, newspapers, and manuscripts
- **Accessibility**: Enabling text-to-speech systems for visually impaired users
- **Data Entry Automation**: Reducing manual data entry from forms, invoices, and receipts
- **Mobile Applications**: Building apps for real-time translation, document scanning, and information extraction
- **Search and Indexing**: Making scanned documents searchable and retrievable

> **Note**: Detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided as the project reaches stability.
